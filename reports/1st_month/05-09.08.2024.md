# Team Lead Report

## Summary of Activities

### 1. Monitoring Tools:
   - **Introduction to Zabbix, Grafana, Prometheus:**
     - Explored the basics of Zabbix, Grafana, and Prometheus, focusing on their roles in monitoring server performance and identifying bottlenecks.
   - **Server Performance and Bottlenecks:**
     - Gained an understanding of server performance metrics and common bottlenecks.
     - Learned the importance of monitoring and timely alerts in maintaining server health.
   - **Practical Implementation:**
     - **Zabbix:**
       - Installed and configured Zabbix for monitoring essential servers.
       - Added several key hosts to Zabbix and set up alert triggers for CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space.
     - **Grafana:**
       - Integrated Grafana with Prometheus to visualize monitoring data.
       - Created custom dashboards to monitor server performance, focusing on metrics such as CPU load, memory usage, and network traffic.
     - **Prometheus:**
       - Deployed Prometheus for collecting metrics from various services.
       - Configured Prometheus to scrape data from server endpoints and set up alert rules for critical performance thresholds.
     - **Server Assessments:**
       - Conducted in-depth assessments of server performance, focusing on CPU, memory, and I/O operations.
       - Identified and documented potential bottlenecks, particularly in I/O-heavy processes and memory allocation.
  

### 2. First Duty Week:
   - **Practical Experience:**
     - Hands-on experience working with servers during my first week on duty.
     - Successfully handled tasks related to server management and troubleshooting.
     - REL-87; REL-90; REL-93

   - **Collaboration and Improvement:**
     - Created three tasks for a related department (@pduty) to improve infrastructure automation:
       - Two tasks to increase disk space PDEV-2768 PDEV-2740 
       - One task to write a script for deleting pprof files PDEV-2768
     - These improvements are aimed at making the duty easier for our department (@dutyops).
   - **Team Interaction:**
     - Met personally with all my colleagues and can provide positive feedback on each team member.
     - Observed areas for improvement in our processes:
       - Automating the maintenance of servers from which alerts originate.
       - Enhancing the duty handover procedure to focus on solving root causes rather than passing unresolved issues to the next colleague.
