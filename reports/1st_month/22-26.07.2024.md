# Team Lead Report

## Summary of Activities

## Planned Tasks Completed:
1. **Working with databases: MongoDB, ClickHouse, PostgreSQL, Redis**
   - **MongoDB:**
     - Worked on the backup of MongoDB databases and collections.
     - Implemented the ability to restore data from backups.
     - Gained an understanding of how MongoDB clusters work.
     - Developed a web application as a pet project using frontend, backend, and MongoDB as the database, all orchestrated with Docker Compose.
   - **ClickHouse:**
     - Studied the architecture and functionality of ClickHouse.
   - **PostgreSQL:**
     - Configured PGSQL Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) architecture using Docker.
     - Implemented backup strategies including full, incremental, and differential backups.
   - **Redis:**
     - Configured Redis Sentinel Cluster architecture using Docker.
     - Implemented backup strategies including full, incremental, and differential backups.
     - Gained an understanding of Redis health, recovery from crashes, and features of its operation.
     - Studied the structure of Redis clusters and implemented a Redis cluster setup.

## Additional Achievements:
1. **Scripting and Automation:**
   - Wrote `script.sh` for automating the backup and restore processes for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis to ensure repeatability in any environment.
   - Utilized `cron`, `pg_dump`, and `rsync` to schedule and manage backups effectively.

2. **Project on ClickHouse:**
   - **Objective:** Enhance understanding of ClickHouse and implement a project demonstrating its high performance for analytical queries.
   - **Steps Taken:**
     - Set up a ClickHouse server using Docker.
     - Created a schema for a sample dataset and imported data.
     - Implemented queries to demonstrate ClickHouse's capabilities in handling large datasets efficiently.
     - Analyzed query performance and optimization techniques.

3. **Telephone Conversation with Yuri Tokarchuk:**
   - Discussed the topic of “replacing redirector mirrors” both manually and using a bot.
4. **Get more acceses to different admin panels, redirecrors etc.**

## Detailed Project Work:
1. **MongoDB Project:**
   - Developed a web application integrating frontend and backend with MongoDB.
   - Used Docker Compose to manage application components.
   - Ensured the application is scalable and supports backup and restore functionalities.

2. **Backup Strategies Implementation:**
   - **MongoDB:**
     - Full backup using `mongodump`.
     - Incremental and differential backups using oplog.
   - **PostgreSQL:**
     - Full backup using `pg_dump`.
     - Incremental and differential backups using custom scripts.
   - **Redis:**
     - Full backup using `redis-cli save`.
     - Incremental backups using `redis-cli bgsave`.
     - Implemented Redis Sentinel for high availability and automated failover.
     - Studied the health of Redis and recovery processes.
     - Implemented and understood Redis clusters.

## Next Steps:
- **NATS:**
  - Gain knowledge of the principles of NATS.
  - Build and manage a NATS cluster.
- **Nginx:**
  - Learn to work with vhost, location, proxying, and other Nginx configurations.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Gain proficiency in using Zabbix, Grafana, and Prometheus for monitoring.
  - Add hosts to monitoring systems and adjust settings based on alerts.
- **Terraform Development:**
  - Continue developing Terraform skills to write modules for our IaC infrastructure.
  - Store and manage Terraform modules in GitLab to enhance team collaboration.
