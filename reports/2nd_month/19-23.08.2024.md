     - Started a project aimed at deploying, monitoring, and troubleshooting Java-based microservices using Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka within a Kubernetes cluster.
   - **Tasks Completed:**
     - Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube and prepared a Docker registry for pushing Docker images.
     - Created Dockerfiles and built Docker images for Eureka Server and Client, which were then pushed to the registry.
     - Wrote Kubernetes manifests for deploying and managing the Eureka Server and Client, ensuring they can communicate properly within the cluster.
     - Configured ConfigMaps and Secrets for managing environment variables, and implemented networking to allow proper communication between services.
     - Deployed a simple Ingress to expose the Eureka Client’s endpoint externally and integrated basic logging and monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
