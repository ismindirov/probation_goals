### Core Configuration

**3. Nginx Configuration Files**:

- **Understanding `nginx.conf`**:
  The `nginx.conf` file is the main configuration file for Nginx, containing directives and context that define the behavior of the web server.
  - **Example**: The `nginx.conf` file typically starts with the main context, which includes global settings such as the user Nginx runs as and the number of worker processes. The events context defines how Nginx handles connections. The HTTP context contains settings for handling HTTP traffic, such as server blocks and location blocks.
  **Practical Task**: Explore and describe the structure and key sections of the `nginx.conf` file.
  - **Definition of Done**: Submit a document detailing the main sections of `nginx.conf`, such as the main, events, and HTTP contexts.

- **The Role of Context and Directives**:
  Nginx configuration consists of directives organized into different contexts (e.g., main, events, http, server, location).
  - **Example**: The main context includes directives that affect the overall operation of Nginx, such as the number of worker processes. The HTTP context is used for configuring HTTP-related settings and can include multiple server blocks. Each server block can contain location blocks that define how to process specific request URIs.
  **Practical Task**: Create a sample `nginx.conf` with custom directives.
  - **Definition of Done**: Provide a working `nginx.conf` file that includes custom settings for each context.

**4. Server Blocks (Virtual Hosts)**:

- **Defining Server Blocks**:
  Server blocks allow Nginx to host multiple websites on a single server, each with its own configuration.
  - **Example**: A server block can be used to host `example.com` with its own document root, log files, and other settings, while another server block can be used for `example.org` with completely different settings. This allows a single Nginx instance to manage multiple sites efficiently.
  **Practical Task**: Configure a server block for a new website.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Create a new configuration file:

       ```bash
       sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
       ```

    2. Add server block configuration:

       ```nginx
       server {
           listen 80;
           server_name example.com;
           root /var/www/example.com;
           index index.html;
       }
       ```

    3. Enable the site:

       ```bash
       sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
       ```

    4. Test and reload Nginx:

       ```bash
       sudo nginx -t
       sudo systemctl reload nginx
       ```

  - **Definition of Done**: Successfully create and enable a server block for `example.com`.

  **Practical Task**: Add configurations for two different domains.
  - **Definition of Done**: Verify both domains are served correctly by Nginx.

**5. Location Blocks**:

- **Matching URI Patterns**:
  Location blocks define how Nginx handles different URI patterns.
  - **Example**: You can use location blocks to serve static files from a specific directory, proxy requests to a backend server, or return a specific response for certain URIs. For instance, a location block with `location /images/` can serve image files, while `location /api/` can proxy requests to an application server.
  **Practical Task**: Create location blocks to handle different types of content.
  - **Definition of Done**: Configure and verify different location blocks for static content, dynamic content, and API endpoints.

### Advanced Configuration

**6. Reverse Proxy**:

- **Setting up Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**:
  Nginx can act as a reverse proxy to forward client requests to backend servers.
