### Objects

### PostgreSQL Components: Objects and Descriptions

| Object       | Description                                                                                                                                     |

| **Table**    | A table is a collection of rows and columns that stores data in a relational format. Tables are the primary data storage objects in PostgreSQL. |
| **Row**      | A row (or record) represents a single, structured data item in a table. Each row is made up of fields, which correspond to the columns of the table.|
| **Column**   | A column is a set of data values of a particular type, one for each row of the table. Columns define the structure of the table.                  |
| **Sequence** | A sequence is a special kind of database object designed for generating unique numeric identifiers. They are often used for auto-incrementing primary keys. |
| **Schema**   | A schema is a logical container that holds a collection of related database objects such as tables, views, indexes, sequences, functions, and more. |
| **Index**    | An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional storage and write overhead. |
| **View**     | A view is a virtual table that provides a way to look at data from one or more tables. Views do not store data themselves but present data stored in tables. |
| **Trigger**  | A trigger is a set of instructions that automatically executes in response to a specified event on a table or view, such as an insert, update, or delete. |
| **Function** | A function is a stored procedure that performs a specific task, such as calculations or data manipulation, and can be reused in SQL statements. |
| **Constraint** | A constraint is a rule enforced on data columns to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data. Common constraints include primary key, foreign key, unique, not null, and check constraints. |
| **Primary Key** | A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that the column(s) do not contain duplicate values or NULLs. |
| **Foreign Key** | A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that uniquely identifies rows in another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables and ensures referential integrity. |
| **Unique Key** | A unique key is a column or a set of columns that ensures all values in the column(s) are unique across the table. Unlike the primary key, a table can have multiple unique keys. |
| **Check Constraint** | A check constraint ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition. |
| **Aggregate Function** | Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, and `MAX`. |
| **Data Type** | Data types define the kind of data that can be stored in a column. Examples include `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`, `BOOLEAN`, etc. |
| **Tablespace** | A tablespace is a storage location where the actual data files of PostgreSQL tables and indexes reside. It allows the administrator to manage disk layout of the database. |
| **Role** | A role in PostgreSQL is a database entity that can own database objects and have database privileges. Roles can represent a user or a group of users. |
| **Database** | A database is a collection of schemas and the objects within those schemas. PostgreSQL can manage multiple databases on a single instance. |
| **Extension** | Extensions are packages that can be added to PostgreSQL to extend its functionality, such as `pg_trgm` for trigram similarity searches or `PostGIS` for geographic objects. |
